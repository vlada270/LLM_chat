# LLM Chatbot for Higher School of Economics Admissions

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is a chatbot designed to assist prospective students in obtaining information about admissions, academic programs, and university life at the **Higher School of Economics (HSE)**. By leveraging **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, the chatbot provides real-time answers, automating and simplifying the information retrieval process.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Technologies
- **LangChain** â€“ Framework for integrating LLMs
- **Vector Database (Pinecone)** â€“ Efficient information retrieval
- **ReAct Framework** â€“ Combining reasoning and action for decision-making
- **Agents** â€“ Managing user interactions dynamically
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** â€“ Ensuring up-to-date, relevant responses

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Features
âœ… **Conversational Memory** â€“ Context-aware interactions using `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`  
âœ… **Semantic Search** â€“ Retrieves accurate university-related data from a vector database  
âœ… **Dynamic Query Handling** â€“ Uses ReAct agents to provide precise responses  
âœ… **Real-Time Information Retrieval** â€“ Keeps answers relevant and updated

## Installation

## Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/vlada270/LLM_chat.git
   cd LLM_chat
  ```
## Running the chatbot locally:
```
python main.py
```
### Running the web-based interface (if applicable):
``` streamlit run app.py ```
### Testing the chatbot in Python:
```
from chatbot import Chatbot

bot = Chatbot()
response = bot.ask("What are the admission requirements for Computer Science?")
print(response)
```
